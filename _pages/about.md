This is the personal academic homepage of Jun Luo, who received his bachelor's degree from [Yanshan University](https://mec.ysu.edu.cn/index.htm) in 2022 and is recommended for admission to [Chongqing University](http://www.cme.cqu.edu.cn/) for his master's degree. His research interests are visual semantic SLAM and visual inertial SLAM. He was supervised by Professor [Huayan Pu](https://faculty.cqu.edu.cn/HuayanPu/zh_CN/index.htm) and Researcher [Gang Wang](https://slmt.cqu.edu.cn/info/10710/88707.htm). **He is looking for the 2025 fall PhD!!** Welcome interested teachers send an email to contact!

2024-present
======
1. **2024/1/30** Congratulations! Huang Tao and I collaborated on "[A Framework for Real-time Generation of Multi-directional Traversability Maps in Unstructured Environments]"(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10610312) has been accepted by *The 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2024)*! The paper could be presented at the conference! This work focuses on the problem of robot passability in the environment.
2. **2024/4/27**  Congratulations! Huang Tao and I collaborated on "[MD-TLCF: Miner Distance Detection Based on Trajectory-Based Low-Confidence Filter]"(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10553319) has been accepted by the *IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement*! The work focuses on the detection of miners in work scenarios and corresponding physical distances.
3. **2024/6/30**  Congratulations! My research "BE-SLAM: BEV-Enhanced Dynamic Semantic SLAM with Static Object Reconstruction" has been accepted by *The 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Technology Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)!*. This paper will be presented in ABU Dhabi in October this year! The work focuses on the fusion of Visual SLAM and BEV.

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

======
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

2018-2022
======
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
