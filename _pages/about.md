This is the personal homepage of Jun Luo, who received his bachelor's degree from [Yanshan University](https://mec.ysu.edu.cn/index.htm) in 2022 and is recommended for admission to [Chongqing University](http://www.cme.cqu.edu.cn/) for his master's degree. His research interests are visual semantic SLAM and visual inertial SLAM. He was supervised by Professor [Huayan Pu](https://faculty.cqu.edu.cn/HuayanPu/zh_CN/index.htm) and Researcher [Gang Wang](https://slmt.cqu.edu.cn/info/10710/88707.htm). **He is looking for the 2025 fall PhD!!** Welcome interested teachers send an email to contact!

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

======
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
